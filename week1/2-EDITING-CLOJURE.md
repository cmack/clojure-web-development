# Editing Clojure

## IDEs

#### [Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/)

Right now Cursive is still in development. I haven't used it for a lengthy amount
of time but I've been hearing great things. For the moment, Cursive is
installed as a IntelliJ plugin. To get access to the plugin checkout
[Cursive's EAP](https://cursiveclojure.com/eap.html) (it's free).

#### [Nightcode](https://nightcode.info/)

Nightcode is still in it's early days. I haven't tried it at all. Cursive
seems further along. Check it out if you're interested in seeing how
Android development is going in Clojure.

## Text Editor support

#### [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/)

You might have seen the Kickstarter a few years ago. Light Table is implemented
in Clojure and has great Clojure support out of the box (it reminds me more of using
an IDE). Light Table is quite a bit different from other text editors though
and there is a bit of a learning curve. People who use it say it's worth it.

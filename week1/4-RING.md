# Ring

In this workshop we'll be using [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/) to build
a simple Clojure web application. Luminus is built on top of a simple web application
library that *most* Clojure web frameworks and libraries are built on. Follow
the links below in order for an introduction to Ring.

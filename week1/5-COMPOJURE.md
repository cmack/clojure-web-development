## Getting Familiar

To get familiar with Compojure I suggest you try a few little tiny things
starting [here](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Getting-Started)
and then reading [this](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Routes-In-Detail)
as you look at the code. See other wiki articles from there as needed.
